Welcome to the Scottish Animal Shelter database. You can use this website to view all the <a href="/animals">animals</a> and all the <a href="/owners">owners</a> we currently have on the books. You can also <a href="/adoptions/new">assign pets</a> to owners and add new animals and owners to the database.

Some shelters have to euthanise due to lack of space, meaning many healthy animals lose their lives. By rehoming a pet you can give an animal that has been abandoned through no fault of their own a loving, stable home, and help to stop overpopulation.
